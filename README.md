# Moon4K Neo

* My attempt at recoding Moon4K in [NeoFlixel](https://github.com/NeoFlixel-Org/NeoFlixel), my c++ game engine based on HaxeFlixel's code (I guess it's a c++ port of it).

* Funny 4k rhythm game originally made by basically three people

* Download the haxeflixel version on [itch.io](https://yophlox.itch.io/moon4k) or the [releases/tags](https://github.com/yophlox/Moon4K/tags) page!

# TODO

- [ ] Basic 4K Gameplay

- [ ] Easy way to add songs

- [ ] StepMania Chart support

- [ ] In-game Song Downloader
